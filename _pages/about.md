### **Jiawei** Zhang (张佳伟)

I am a zero-year master student at [NCEPU](https://www.ncepu.edu.cn/), studying under Professor Li Yuancheng and following Dr. Li Changlin in the field of artificial intelligence. I have larger passion for the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. I am also an avid open source advocate.
